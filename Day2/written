setImmediate() - is designed to execute a script once the current poll phase completes.will execute immediately. does not use queue of functions only checks the queue of I/O event handlers. when it finishes it executes.
setTimeout() - schedules a script to be run after a minimum threshold in ms has elapsed.will execute after all the executing and queued event handlers.
The main advantage to using setImmediate() over setTimeout() is setImmediate() will always be executed before any timers if scheduled within an I/O cycle, independently of how many timers are present.
